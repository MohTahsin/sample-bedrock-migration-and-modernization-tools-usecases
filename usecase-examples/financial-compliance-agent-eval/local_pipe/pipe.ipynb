    "# Financial Compliance LLM Evaluation Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements an automated MLOps pipeline for evaluating and optimizing Large Language Model (LLM) prompts for financial compliance tasks using Amazon SageMaker Pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipeline automates the complete lifecycle of prompt engineering and model evaluation, from optimization through deployment, with integrated experiment tracking and quality gates.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Architecture Components\n",
    "\n",
    "1. MLflow Integration: Centralized logging of parameters, metrics, and artifacts\n",
    "2. Bedrock Prompt Management: Prompt Versioning,  Automated Optimization\n",
    "3. Modular Pipeline Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pipeline Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Data Preparation  \n",
    "- Retrieves base prompt from Bedrock Prompt Management, optimizes\n",
    "- Logs optimization metrics and improved prompts\n",
    "- Loads ground truth dataset from S3, preprocesses\n",
    "- Validates data format and completeness\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Model Inference\n",
    "- Executes Haystack pipeline with optimized prompts\n",
    "- Generates predictions on test dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Evaluation & Metrics\n",
    "- Calculates accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score\n",
    "- Generates confusion matrix analysis\n",
    "- Logs comprehensive evaluation metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "\n",

    "- Integration with AWS IAM and security best practices\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Configuration Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ModelId`: Bedrock model identifier (default: amazon.nova-lite-v1:0)\n",
    "- `PromptId`: Bedrock Prompt Management ID for base template\n",
    "- `Optimize`: Enable/disable DSPy prompt optimization\n",
    "- `AccuracyThreshold`: Minimum accuracy for deployment (default: 0.8)\n",

    "### Ground Truth Dataset Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset represents a collection of question–answer pairs used to evaluate the performance of the agent. Each row contains both the **query** and the **expected answer**, along with metadata describing how the ground-truth label was sourced.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Columns Explained**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **prompt** — The natural-language question that will be passed to the agent.  \n",
    "  This is the input the agent must answer using either RAG or web search.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **context** — (Optional) The extracted text from the source document used to derive the ground-truth answer.  \n",
    "  - Present for **RAG-labeled** rows.  \n",
    "  - `None` for web-search questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **output** — The ground-truth answer.  \n",
    "  This is the gold-standard response that the agent’s answer will be compared against.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **page** — (For RAG rows) The page number in the Amazon 10-K document where the supporting information was found.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **tool_label** — Indicates which tool should ideally be used to answer the question:  \n",
    "  - **`rag`** → Question relates to *historical Amazon data* found in the PDF.  \n",
    "  - **`web_search`** → Question relates to *current or modern information* requiring external web search.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### How We Use This Data for Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "For each row:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We take the **prompt** and send it to the agent.  \n",
    "2. The agent selects a tool (`rag` or `web_search`) following system rules.  \n",
    "3. The agent returns an answer.  \n",
    "4. We compare the agent’s answer with the **output** column (ground truth).  \n",
    "5. For RAG rows, we can also check if the retrieved chunks match the **context** column.  \n",
    "6. Metrics such as accuracy, similarity scores, or nDCG are computed to determine how close the agent’s answer is to the ground truth.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process allows us to measure:\n",
    "- Tool-selection correctness  \n",
    "- Factual correctness  \n",
    "- Retrieval quality for RAG-based questions  \n",
    "- Overall agent reliability across mixed data sources  \n"
